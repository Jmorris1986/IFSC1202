malware_defense_ping — Defensive network liveness checker

Purpose

This small utility helps defenders and incident responders check host liveness across an approved set of systems. It is intended for lawful, authorized monitoring only.

Features

- Uses the system `ping` command where available (ICMP) and falls back to a TCP connect check.
- Async concurrent checks with configurable concurrency and timeout.
- Logs timestamped results to a log file.

Usage examples

1) Check hosts listed in a file (one per line):

```bash
python3 malware_defense_ping.py --targets-file targets.txt --concurrency 50 --timeout 2
```

2) Check specific hosts directly:

```bash
python3 malware_defense_ping.py --hosts 192.0.2.1 example.com --method tcp --port 443
```

Security and policy notes

- Only run this tool on networks and systems you are authorized to monitor. Unauthorized scanning or network probing may be illegal or violate acceptable-use policies.
- ICMP/ping behavior varies by OS and by remote firewalls. A host may be "up" but reject ICMP.
- This tool is intended for monitoring and defense; it does not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or move laterally.

Extending the tool

- You can add other health checks (HTTP GET, SNMP, SSH banner) if you need more granular service checks.
- Consider adding authentication and secure logging/centralization when used at scale.

Logs

By default the script appends to `malware_defense_ping.log` in the working directory. Modify `--log` to change location.
